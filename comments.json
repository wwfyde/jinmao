    "comment": "I would normally never buy a \"bermuda\" length bc i feel like it doesnt look flattering on my more pear-shaped build but these fit great and true to size. A great alternative to shorter denim shorts and length prevents chafing thighs and the lengths bunching up at the crotch when walking. \n\nThe waistband is fairly comfortable but if u sit for long periods of time u might find the waistband starting to dig in since it doesnt have much stretch in the waist. \n\nI actually prefer the look of a raw hem but i wish GAP would put a stay stitch so it wont start unraveling once u throw it in the wash. Overall i recommend this short!",

Not tight, but not loose either, so I would say these are true to size. I saw another review stating they were way too loose in the legs for her but not for me! Obviously it depends on how thick your thighs are. I'm going to try the 28 for a looser/slouchier fit. I'll see if that works to get the fit I want.",

I fold it up and maybe will sew it. The shorts are a good length now though. Bottomline- these are high rise so look like old lady shorts, not what I wanted.",

I figured they would be too big and have to be returned, but they actually fit very well (slightly roomy in the waist, bit fitted in the rear). So I'd say these run a bit small. They are comfortable, the high waist is great and the length is spot on for me. I am 5\"6, size 12.",
