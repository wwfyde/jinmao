They are everything I always wanted in a skinny jean. I\'m a thin gal, but skinny jeans are almost always too tight in the calf for me. When I walk, I always have to pull my jeans up, because the movement of my calves pulls the jeans down. These are perfect because they are slim, but allow for movement. They are probably more flattering than skinny jeans for most people, since the silhouette isn\'t as extreme. Classic fit.  Audrey Hepburn vibes with a modern twist.

Yes, they have made a tall shirt line, but they are wanting $2 more for 1.5 inches of extra length and they dont come in any bright pretty colors. I have bought ANA T\'s in the past a blend of cotton, modal and spandex which I absolutely love. But I am unable to find any more. I saw these and thought, same length but all cotton, should do the same. Nope!! As for the COLOR, NOT EVEN CLOSE. I bought 12 different colors and the basics are pretty right on. Blk, whylt, yel, Oregano. But as for the Beautiful brights... nope. They are NOT A DEEP color like you see on the screen. The digital lens as distorted the colors. They are a between pastel and deep. Turquoise is blue, french is a darker mint, coral is more peachy, cabaret red is red, Honolulu purple is not a deep pink, it\'s a lighter purple, rasp rose is a med pink,  and violet is purple. 
To be truthful the NAMES probably fit the actual color of what they were thinking when they came up with the names. But once you digitally take and upload, they are not true to color shown. I was going to take picts to show the color, than realize they were the actual colors I wanted thru my lenses, not what I actually have sitting in front of me. So, if you want a comfortable color T, these are good. But if you want them for the color you see, you wont. And for the length well...

A quick google search of "women\'s cotton t-shirts" produced a hit for these St. John\'s Bay shirts, so I thought I would give them a try.  They are superior to the t-shirts Kohl\'s is selling and I got a great deal.  The fit, feel and workmanship on these St. John\'s t-shirts are good.  Thanks JC Penny...

By the way, it\'s little expensive for me too. But I sent a photo of this jacket to my granddaughter. At least I\'ll find out we have the same kind of taste or not.
I got an answer: "This one is perfect!"
While we were texting, the price magically fell. And after the promo offer there were no doubts. The delivery was fast. The jacket is great, stylish, sewn perfectly. All seams are even. The outer side pockets are large and form two extra inner pockets. It is very convenient. However, I should take a smaller size. My girl wears a size S, but she asked me to buy a little bigger.

I had to purchase a 30 petite to finally get the right fit. Note these pants are low stetch material so do not expect any give with these jeans. 

On the other hand the acid washed color is definitely awesome and once you can nail your comfortable fit they are good.

I didnt want to give up on these but here is my experience:

28 petite - I cant even pull these up let along zip them. Returned.
29 short - i can pull them up, and can zip them up halfway before im dying. Returned.
28 short - I tried the 29 short first and I didn\'t even bother. Returned.
30 petite - full length as stated and appropriately snug through hips and thighs. KEEP!
