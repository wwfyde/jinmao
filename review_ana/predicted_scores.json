A great alternative to shorter denim shorts and length prevents chafing thighs and the lengths bunching up at the crotch when walking. \n\nThe waistband is fairly comfortable but if u sit for long periods of time u might find the waistband starting to dig in since it doesnt have much stretch in the waist. \n\nI actually prefer the look of a raw hem but i wish GAP would put a stay stitch so it wont start unraveling once u throw it in the wash. Overall i recommend this short!",

Not tight, but not loose either, so I would say these are true to size. I saw another review stating they were way too loose in the legs for her but not for me! Obviously it depends on how thick your thighs are. I'm going to try the 28 for a looser/slouchier fit. I'll see if that works to get the fit I want.",
